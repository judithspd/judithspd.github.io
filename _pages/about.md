About me
======
I hold a degree in Mathematics with a major in Computer Science from the University of Cantabria (UC), which I completed in 2020. During my undergraduate studies, I was awarded with a scholarship to pursue a Master's in Entrepreneurship at the UC-Centro Internacional de Santander Emprendimiento. This opportunity allowed me to gain cross-disciplinary and soft skills in addition to the technical and analytical competencies I developed during the Mathematics degree.

Following this, I completed the Master's in Data Science from the Menéndez Pelayo International University (UIMP) and the University of Cantabria (UC). Since completing this Master's program, I have been working as a Data Science Researcher at the [Advanced Computing and e-Science Group](https://advancedcomputing.ifca.es/) at the [Institute of Physics of Cantabria](https://ifca.unican.es), affiliated with the [Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](https://www.csic.es/).

In September 2022 I joined the PhD program in Science and Technology at the University of Cantabria, to develop my PhD thesis on privacy preserving techniques in data science environments.

I'm currently working on different European projects focused on the development of advanced AI techniques, such as the [AI4EOSC project](https://ai4eosc.eu/), and also on the EOSC SIESTA project which aims to provide a set of tools for the effective sharing, management and analysis of sensitive data.

Research interests
======
- Federated learning and others privacy preserving machine learning techniques.
- Data privacy: anonymization, pseudonimization, differential privacy.
- Privacy enhancing technologies.
- Application of federated learning to different use cases: medical imaging, water quality, etc.
- Artificial intelligence: machine learning and deep learning.
