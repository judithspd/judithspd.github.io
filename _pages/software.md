In my day-to-day work, I write a lot of code, especially for privacy-preserving deep learning applications, federated learning, and privacy-enhancing technologies. In this section, you'll find some of the software I've developed that's available to the public as open-source Python libraries.
 
- [*ANJANA*](https://github.com/IFCA-Advanced-Computing/anjana): a Python library to anonymize sensitive tabular data.

	Authors: Judith Sáinz-Pardo Díaz and Álvaro López García (IFCA - CSIC).

	The ANJANA documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://anjana.readthedocs.io/). It can be installed using [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/anjana/).

	More information can be found in this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-04019-z). 
	If you are using ANJANA you can cite it as follows:
	```bibtex

	  volume={11},
	  number={1},
	  pages={1289},
	  year={2024},
	  publisher={Nature Publishing Group UK London}
	}
	```
	
- [*pyCANON*](https://github.com/IFCA-Advanced-Computing/pycanon): a Python library to check the level of anonymity of a dataset. 

	pyCANON is a Python library and CLI to assess the values of the parameters associated with the most common privacy-preserving techniques. 

	Authors: Judith Sáinz-Pardo Díaz and Álvaro López García (IFCA - CSIC).

	The pyCANON documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://pycanon.readthedocs.io/). It can be installed using [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pycanon/).

	More information can be found in this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01894-2).
