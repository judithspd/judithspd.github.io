**Abstract**
In this work the applicability of an ensemble of population and machine learning models to predict the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain is evaluated, relying solely on public datasets. Firstly, using only incidence data, we trained machine learning models and adjusted classical ODE-based population models, especially suited to capture long term trends. As a novel approach, we then made an ensemble of these two families of models in order to obtain a more robust and accurate prediction. We then proceed to improve machine learning models by adding more input features: vaccination, human mobility and weather conditions. However, these improvements did not translate to the overall ensemble, as the different model families had also different prediction patterns. Additionally, machine learning models degraded when new COVID variants appeared after training. We finally used Shapley Additive Explanation values to discern the relative importance of the different input features for the machine learning models’ predictions. The conclusion of this work is that the ensemble of machine learning models and population models can be a promising alternative to SEIR-like compartmental models, especially given that the former do not need data from recovered patients, which are hard to collect and generally unavailable.
