**Abstract**
Machine learning is one of the most widely used technologies in the field of Artificial Intelligence. As machine learning applications become increasingly ubiquitous, concerns about data privacy and security have also grown. The work in this paper presents a broad theoretical landscape concerning the evolution of machine learning and deep learning from centralized to distributed learning, first in relation to privacy-preserving machine learning and secondly in the area of privacy-enhancing technologies. It provides a comprehensive landscape of the synergy between distributed machine learning and privacy-enhancing technologies, with federated learning being one of the most prominent architectures. Various distributed learning approaches to privacy-aware techniques are structured in a review, followed by an in-depth description of relevant frameworks and libraries, more particularly in the context of federated learning. The paper also highlights the need for data protection and privacy addressed from different approaches, key findings in the field concerning AI applications, and advances in the development of related tools and techniques.
